# hello-world
Repository for getting used to github

My name is Matthew. I'm new to github and still trying to get used to it and
still trying to understand get better at using it. In this repository I am just now still in the process of using github since I don't have a lot of experience with it since I'm just now starting to use it for the first time. This repository is the first one that I did doing the first thing that I learned how to code "Hello World". This is a classic program that all students should learn to do with them having to or needing to take coding classes no matter college they attend and whatever field of study that they are going into involving computers. This program is a very basic one; but it is a really good one to learn and too improve on your computer coding skills from there.
